# PFP vs. SILVER-Seq serum

To compare the results of the data analysis using the SILVER-seq data, we analysed RNA-seq data from platelet free plasma (PFP) (four samples). The PFP data originates from a stranded, paired-end library. The data from SILVER-seq is single-end data and we deduducted that the data is non-stranded using the *infer_experiment.py* function from [RSeQC](http://rseqc.sourceforge.net/), as this information is not mentioned in the paper.
